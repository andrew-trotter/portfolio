        <p className="mb-4">My journey began in 2017, stemming from a funky background in digital print, and later transitioned into art gallery/caf√© management in 2021. The world of print, paper, and flat whites was fascinating, but I yearned for something more.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">In 2023, I decided to take a leap of faith into the dynamic realm of web development. I plunged headfirst into a 15-week bootcamp program run by Dev Academy. With a curriculum focused on teaching technical and human skills in parallel, I emerged not just a survivor but a victor. Starting with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, progressing through TypeScript, Handlebars, and Jest, and ending with a proficiency in React.js, RESTful API&apos;s, and ViTest - I am now fully armed with a robust toolkit of technical and soft skills, ready to dive headfirst into the industry.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">When I&apos;m away from the keyboard, I don&apos;t hang up my adventurous spirit - you can find me hiking, bouldering, or taking on epic quests in the realm of video games.</p>
