        <p className="mb-4">
          My journey began in 2017, stemming from a funky background in digital
          print, and later transitioned into art gallery/caf√© management in
          2021. The world of print, paper, and flat whites was fascinating, but
          I yearned for something more.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In 2023, I decided to take a leap of faith into the dynamic realm of
          web development. I plunged head-first into a 15-week bootcamp program
          run by Dev Academy Aotearoa. With a curriculum focused on teaching
          technical and human skills in parallel, I emerged more confident and
          knowledgeable of who I am.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Starting with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          progressing through TypeScript, Handlebars, and Jest, and ending with
          proficiency in React, Redux, RESTful API&apos;s, and ViTest - I am now
          fully armed with a robust toolkit of technical and soft skills, ready
          to dive into the industry.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When I&apos;m away from the keyboard, I don&apos;t hang up my
          adventurous spirit - you can find me hiking, bouldering, or embarking
          on epic quests in the unique and diverse world of video games.
